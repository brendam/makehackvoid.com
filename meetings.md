Maker Meetups
============

First, third and fifth Tuesdays of every month are Maker Meetups. 6:15pm at [the space](/community/our-space).  You can [check the calendar for exact dates](/#calendar). 

At Maker Meetups you can check out the Makerspace, meet interesting people in Canberra’s Maker community and see the cool stuff people are working on. If you’ve been working on something that you’d like to share, you’ll find plenty of people keen to hear about your progress and the challenges you’ve faced. You can bounce ideas around, compare notes or draw on collective experience and knowledge to help progress through tricky parts of your projects.

Everyone is welcome - all ages, interests and skill levels. 

Because the space is a workshop, you will need to wear covered shoes. 

[Check out the community calendar](/#calendar) and copy the next Maker Meetup into your own calendar.

If you are unable to make it to our Maker Meetups, but wish to check out the space, keep an eye out for space openings and drop by some time.
