Another (Completed!!) project is a DDR (Dance dance revolution) board for the Dreamcast.

![DDR Board](/images/projects/ddr-board-dreamcast/board.jpg)

I will let the pictures speak for themselves but it is made of MDF with thin aluminium sheet contact cemented down over the top, L-brackets and polycarbonate squares for the pads. Wiring it up was as easy as soldering to the correct buttons on the control pad.

**Nice one!**

Nice one! What are the switch contacts on the pads made out of? Any problems with durability?

    **The contacts are just micro switches**
    *Combust — Tue, 15/06/2010 - 10:16am*
    The contacts are just micro switches that are in contact with the polycarbonate squares. The mounting points for them are adjustable so you can minimise issues with timing.

    All I can say is its solid. No problems with anything wearing out so far Smile

**Plans/Parts**

Will you be posting the plans/parts that you used?

    **I think ill be able to do**
    *Combust — Wed, 23/06/2010 - 10:43am*
    I think ill be able to do that. It was created by me so there are no plans as such but I can definately give dimensions and materials (And tips!). Give me a few days and ill get them together.

        **Few weeks, 3 months...**

        Few weeks, 3 months... hehe



        No dimentions yet but i have the following materials:

        MDF 200mm from memory = Bunnings

        Thin sheet aluminium (Thinner the better) = Bunnings

        L-Brackets (Shelf?) = Bunnings

        Microswitches = Jaycar

        Microswitch brackets = Scrap metal bent to a 'Z' shape

        Contact cement = Bunnings

            **Thank you!**
            *pd12 — Fri, 24/09/2010 - 1:27am*
            Cool, thanks!

            I'll put this into my list of projects to do =)
